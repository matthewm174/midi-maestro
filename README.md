# midi-maestro
just a little midi piano roll that uses a very simple markov chains to generate sequences. i have some more fun plans to implement in the future but that will be entirely dependent on free time.
<br/>
this is also a typescript/vue rewrite of the piano roll here https://github.com/g200kg/webaudio-pianoroll using some of the nice features available in vue.

# run
npm install <br/>
npm run dev

select a scale, root note, hit the random generate button.
