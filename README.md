# midi-maestro
just a little midi piano roll that uses a very simple markov chain to generate 16 step sequences. i have some more fun plans to implement in the future but that will be entirely dependent on free time.

this is also a typescript/vue rewrite of the piano roll here https://github.com/g200kg/webaudio-pianoroll using some of the nice features available in vue.

#run
npm install
npm run dev

hit the random generate button, or write your own music.
